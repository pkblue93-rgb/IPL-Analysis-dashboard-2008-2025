##Process
Data Collection & Cleaning → Import ball-by-ball, matches, players, and teams data into Power BI and clean using Power Query.
Data Modeling → Build relationships between tables (match_id, team_id, player_id).
DAX Measures (KPIs) → Create formulas for total 6s, 4s, centuries, wins, points, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, top 4s & 6s.
Visualizations → Use cards, tables, charts, slicers, and images for interactive insights.
Dashboard Layout → Arrange season filter, winners/runner-up, stats, team table, and player highlights.
Test & Publish → Validate KPIs, apply filters, and publish to Power BI Service.
